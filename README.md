## Project Portfolio: Swire Coca-Cola

## Business Problem and Project Objective

#### Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance model for Swire Coca-Cola's production plants that accurately forecasts machine downtimes.
This model will help the company identify the reasons behind machine breakdowns, optimize repair processes, and ultimately reduce the financial losses associated with unplanned downtimes.

#### Business and Analytic Problems

Swire Coca-Cola currently faces significant challenges due to the mechanical limitations of its production plants.
Key issues include:

1.  **Unplanned Downtimes**: Approximately 5.6% of production cases are lost due to unforeseen mechanical issues, resulting in annual losses of about \$60 million.

2.  **Inadequate Predictive Insights**: The existing approach relies on reactive measures after a breakdown occurs, making it difficult to anticipate issues before they impact production.

3.  **Data Utilization**: There is a need to analyze the downtime records stored in the Internal Warehouse Controller (IWC) system, which only captures severe breakdowns, limiting the insights available for predicting future issues.

## Our Solution

Our group's solution was to develop a survival analysis model that estimates when machines are likely to fail, creating unplanned work orders. Two of our key findings were (1) that there are significantly more unplanned work orders than planned work orders and (2) that unplanned work orders take longer to resolve (on average). Using our survival analysis, Swire can develop a more proactive maintenance plan to reduce machine downtime and save money.

## My Contribution

All group members contributed to all aspects of the project. However, I was more heavily involved in putting together the modelling notebook and developing our business value simulation and the accompanying visualizations. I also built a text based prediction model for work order time that was not included in the final version of our presentation.

## Business Value

Using a boostrap simulation, we estimate that implementing a maintenance plan that reduces unplanned work orders from roughly 89% to 80% could save Swire $25 million over a ten year time horizon. A more aggressive maintenance plan could save even more. It is up to company executives to decide if these savings justify the cost of implementation. 

## Difficulties

Overall, our group worked well together and we didn't face any major hurdles. Our biggest difficulty was lack of time. All of us were busy with work and other classes, so much of the work was left until the last week before the due date. Personally, I wish I was able to dedicate more time to my text based prediction model.

## What I Learned

During this project, I learned a lot about the messiness of real world data and vague business problems. Before this assignment, I don't think I realized how big of a difference there is between the toy examples we use in class and actual analytics problems.
actual analytics projects.
