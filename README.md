## Project Portfolio: Swire Coca-Cola

## Business Problem and Project Objective

#### Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance model for Swire Coca-Cola's production plants that accurately forecasts machine downtimes.
This model will help the company identify the reasons behind machine breakdowns, optimize repair processes, and ultimately reduce the financial losses associated with unplanned downtimes.

#### Business and Analytic Problems

Swire Coca-Cola currently faces significant challenges due to the mechanical limitations of its production plants.
Key issues include:

1.  **Unplanned Downtimes**: Approximately 5.6% of production cases are lost due to unforeseen mechanical issues, resulting in annual losses of about \$60 million.

2.  **Inadequate Predictive Insights**: The existing approach relies on reactive measures after a breakdown occurs, making it difficult to anticipate issues before they impact production.

3.  **Data Utilization**: There is a need to analyze the downtime records stored in the Internal Warehouse Controller (IWC) system, which only captures severe breakdowns, limiting the insights available for predicting future issues.
